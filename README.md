# Pulse Oximeter 2021

It is a project based on two components: 

- Hardware; An Arduino controller, a pulse-oximeter sensor, and a Bluetooth module to read, interpret, process and send data about vital signs wireless to the second part of this project.

- Software; An Android mobile application (Java) is used to manage and display the recorded data.

The purpose of this project was to create an easy-to-use, portable device to accurately measure vital signs and to improve the communication between the doctor and his patients. The measured data is instantly accessible for review, using the mobile application.
